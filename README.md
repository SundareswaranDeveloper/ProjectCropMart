# Project Crop Mart 

# Introduction :

Project Crop Mart was the idea of developing an e-commerce system for farmers to sell their products and customers to purchase their required products.

Using Java, Jsp, Servlet for backend services, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend UI.

Designed and implemented a secure MySQL database, ensuring seamless integration with backend services for data transfer operations.

Utilized Eclipse as a development environment.
